# Sticky Notes Backend

Sticky Notes is a note app with the functions of creating, editing, archiving, and deleting notes. In addition, it allows you to assign a color to the notes allowing categorize and filter them, including the ability to search both by title and body of the note. Finally, the application has internationalization (English and Spanish) and a basic JWT-based authentication system.

## Stack

![Node] ![Typescript] ![Fastify] ![Prisma] ![Postgres]

This repository contains the third backend version of Sticky Notes, developed with Node.js, Typescript and Fastify framework, using Prisma as ORM for a PostgreSQL database. I decided to build this version with Fastify because I wanted to practice with this framework and because it seems like a modern version of Express with default Typescript support.
